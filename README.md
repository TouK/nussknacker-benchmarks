# nussknacker-benchmarks

Projects downloads and displays data from benchmarks in [Nussknacker](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker/blob/staging/.github/workflows/benchmark.yml)
and [Nussknacker Quickstart](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker-quickstart/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmark-workflow.yml).

Data are downloaded daily, currently old data is overwritten, so charts will present only data from last 3 months.
